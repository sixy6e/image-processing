    Calculates the Otsu threshold.

    Seperates the input array into background and foreground components
    by finding the maximum between class variance.

    :param image:
        A numpy array of maximum three dimensions.

    :param fast:
        Default is True. Will find the optimal threshold using the fast method
        which approximates the mean value per class.

    :param apply_threshold:
        Default is False. If True then a mask/masks of the same dimensions as
        image will be returned. Otherwise only the threshold/thresholds will be
        returned.

    :param binsize:
        (Optional) The binsize (Default is 1) to be used for creating the
        histogram.

    :param maxv:
        (Optional) The maximum value to be used in creating the histogram. If
        not specified the array will be searched for max.

    :param minv:
        (Optional) The minimum value to be used in creating the histogram. If
        not specified the array will be searched for min.

    :param nbins:
        (Optional) The number of bins to be used for creating the histogram.
        If set binsize is calculated as (max - min) / (nbins - 1), and the max
        value will be adjusted to (nbins*binsize + min).

        not specified the array will be searched for min.

    :param nbins:
        (Optional) The number of bins to be used for creating the histogram.
        If set binsize is calculated as (max - min) / (nbins - 1), and the max
        value will be adjusted to (nbins*binsize + min).

    :param Apply:
        If True (Default), then the threshold will be applied and an array of
        type bool will be returned. Otherwise just the threshold will be
        returned.

    :param invert:
        If True (Default is False), then the returned mask will be inverted.
        Only valid if Apply=True.
        The inverted mask is applied as:

        (array < threshold) & (array >= min).

        The non-inverted mask is applied as:

        (array >= threshold) & (array <= max)
